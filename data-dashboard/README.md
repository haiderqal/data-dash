Web Development Project 5 - ðŸ“± Cellphone Store Dashboard
Submitted by: Haider Ali

This web app: Displays a dashboard of cellphone stores (T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, etc.) with summary stats, search, and filter options. The app uses React, async API data fetching, and dynamic rendering.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Required Features
The following required functionality is completed:

 The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call

The dashboard displays 10 unique cellphone stores, one per row

Each row includes two features: store name and store type

 useEffect React hook and async/await are used

 The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data

Total number of stores

Number of unique store types

Number of stores currently displayed after search/filter

 A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data

The search bar correctly filters items in the list based on store name

The list dynamically updates as the user types

 An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories

The filter restricts items by store type (Carrier, Retail Chain, Authorized Retailer, etc.)

The dashboard dynamically updates as the user adjusts the filter

The following optional features are implemented:

 Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously

 Filters use different input types (radio, slider, etc.)

 The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

The following additional features are implemented:

 Clean, modern styling with custom CSS

 Smooth hover animations and responsive layout

Making the filter and search work together smoothly

CSS styling to make the dashboard look professional

Remembering to import the App.css file for the styles to show
